Bugzilla Remote Sync Extension
==============================

Goal of this extension is to provide a way to link bugs in remote Bugzilla
instances (and possibly other bug tracking systems) and automatically sync some
some changes between the local and remote bug.

Target is to help working more directly with upstream projects and still allow
tracking time, dependencies, etc. in your own Bugzilla instance.

        extensions/RemoteTrack
